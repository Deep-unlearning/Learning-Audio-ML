# My Journey into Learning Audio ML

## About

This repository documents my journey into learning Audio ML, bridging the gap in my knowledge as I transition from a more general deep learning background. The exploration is not strictly linear and may branch into broader deep learning topics. It serves as a space for experimentation, implementation of research papers, writing blog posts, and creating tutorials on related subjects.

## What am I currently working on

- ASR:

  - [Fast-Conformer](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/fast-conformer): Implementing Fast-Conformer paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05084) and probably other variants and optimizations.
  
  - Blog post about Audio LMs
  
  - Blog post about distil-whisper + tutorial
 
- TTS:

  - Finetuning Llasa: [Blog Post](https://huggingface.co/blog/Steveeeeeeen/llasagna) [Repo](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/LLaSA_training)
