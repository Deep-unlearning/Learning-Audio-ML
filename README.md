# My Journey into Learning Audio ML

## About

This repository documents my journey into learning Audio ML, bridging the gap in my knowledge as I transition from a more general deep learning background. The exploration is not strictly linear and may branch into broader deep learning topics. It serves as a space for experimentation, implementation of research papers, writing blog posts, and creating tutorials on related subjects.

## What am I currently working on

- ASR:

  - [Fast-Conformer](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/fast-conformer): Implementing Fast-Conformer paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05084) and probably other variants and optimizations.
 
  - Finetuning Script for [Voxtral model](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/Finetune-Voxtral-ASR)
 
  - [WIP] Study [Slam](https://github.com/slp-rl/slamkit)
  
  - [WIP] Blog post about Audio LMs
  
  - [WIP] Blog post about distil-whisper + tutorial
 
- TTS:

  - [WIP] Blog Post of Speech LLMs: [SpeechLLMs Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Steveeeeeeen/SpeechLLM-Playbook)

  - Finetuning Llasa: [Blog Post](https://huggingface.co/blog/Steveeeeeeen/llasagna) [Repo](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/LLaSA_training)
 
  - Finetuning Dia-TTS: [Repo](https://github.com/Deep-unlearning/Finetune-Dia-TTS)
 
- Audio Codecs:

  - Transformers integration of XCodec2: [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/37868)
